1. What design principles guided your improvements?
   Ans - The main design principles I kept in mind were simplicity, consistency, and user focus. I wanted the design to look clean and easy to understand, so I avoided clutter and made sure the layout felt natural. I also worked on keeping the colors, fonts, and spacing consistent across pages so that everything feels like part of one system. Most importantly, I focused on the user’s experience—making navigation smooth, ensuring important actions are easy to find, and designing in a way that feels familiar, like other apps and websites people already use.

   2. How did you ensure responsiveness across devices?
      Ans - I made sure the design was responsive by using a mobile-first approach and testing the layout on different screen sizes. I used flexbox and grid to create flexible layouts, applied relative units like percentages instead of fixed pixels, and added media queries to adjust styles for tablets and mobiles. I also checked the design on multiple devices and browsers to make sure the content stayed readable and the buttons easy to tap.

      3. What trade-offs did you make between the design and performance?
Ans - One trade-off I had to make was between visual design and performance. For example, adding high-quality images and animations made the design more engaging, but they could slow down loading times. To balance this, I optimized images, limited the number of animations, and used lightweight code so that the site still looked good without affecting speed too much. In short, I tried to keep the design attractive while making sure the performance stayed smooth.

4. What was the most challenging part of the task and how did you approach it?
Ans - The most challenging part was making sure the design looked good and worked well on all devices. At first, some layouts were breaking on smaller screens, which was frustrating. I approached it by testing often, using media queries, and simplifying the layout where needed. I also looked up examples and documentation to see how others handled similar issues. This trial-and-error process helped me fix the problems and improve the overall responsiveness.
